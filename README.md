## Installation

Note: Depending on your Windows version, you may need to manually download and install [Microsoft Edge WebView2 runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section) if not prompted to.

### Linux

- Linux support is currently a work-in-progress, but is avaliable for normal use if you can build it yourself. See [here](https://github.com/lulzsun/RePlays/issues/162) for more information.

## Development

Get started with contributing to the project with this quick [getting started guide](./Development-GettingStarted.md)!

## Technology Stack

RePlays is powered by C# (.NET 8) and Typescript (React). Typescript is used for the interface (frontend), while C# is the core of the program (backend).

The interface is displayed using Microsoft Edge WebView2 on Windows, and WebKit2GTK on Linux.

Recording functionality is currently powered using libobs, thanks to the [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) Project!
