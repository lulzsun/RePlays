# FAQ

## What is the difference between RePlays vs RePlaysTV?

**RePlaysTV** is the late project that patches over the existing Plays.tv software to give it a working offline user interface with plenty of upload platforms and additional features. This has been archived and is no longer in development.

**RePlays** (_without the TV_) is a free and open source program that automatically manages recording of detected running games, with a clip editor that allows for quick video sharing.

RePlays is software made from scratch, inspired by Plays.tv. It was created as a result of the deeper issues that underlie within the Plays.tv software that can't feasibly be fixed.
